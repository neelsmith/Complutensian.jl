## Outline

### Intra-lingual alignment

- document content is aligned by canonical citation
- parse documents
- filter to isolate verbal features
- see if same lexical entity occurs in a document
- if not, see how often entity cooccurs with each other verb
- for verbs in "missing" documents of a passage, find highest rank co-occurrence

### Cross-lingual alignment

- parse parallel documents in all languages
- extend the method in cases of non-identical lexemes
