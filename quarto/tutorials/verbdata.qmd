# Analyzing verb data

Use package, load data:

```{julia}
#| warning: false
#| output: false
using Complutensian
verbdata = loadverbdata()
```

Collect all verb ids:

```{julia}
allverbs = verblist(verbdata)
length(allverbs)
```

```{julia}
allverbs[1]
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Labelling lexeme IDs"}

Default labelling dictionary is a list of the first `n` occurrences of the lexeme in the Vulgate.
```{julia}
labels = loadlabels()
labellex(allverbs[1]; labelsdict = labels)
```
:::

Use a verb ID to find all passages where the verb occurs. Passages are identified by a sequential integer.

```{julia}
gigno = "ls.n19570"
psgsequences = passagesforverb(gigno, verbdata)
length(psgsequences)
```

The result is ordered. The first occurrence of *gigno* is in the 84th passage.

```{julia}
psgsequences[1]
```



Find frequencies of each lexeme in the data set. The resulting Dict is organized by passage; since each passage has three documents, this is valuable for our alignment work.

The size of this dictionary will be the same as the number of passages.

```{julia}
verbcountsbylexeme = countsbyverb(verbdata)
verbcountsbylexeme[gigno] |> length
```

In fact, they are the keys to the next tier, so each of those passage numbers will next give us
*all* the other lexemes in that passage: the cooccurrence list, on other words.
```{julia}
psgnum = verbcountsbylexeme[gigno][84]

psg84lexx = lexemesforpsg(psgnum, verbdata)
labellex.(psg84lexx; labelsdict = labels)
```


## Scoring



```{julia}
vivo = "ls.n51238"
slashline(vivo, verbdata)
```



```{julia}
cooccurencescores(vivo, verbdata)
```
